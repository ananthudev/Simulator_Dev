There is a issue in the stages section, this is all before user saves the subsequent stages sectionm user may delete or add more stages and motors. before filling the data. when user add multiple stages. and add motors in their subsequent number of motors input box in the stages. it is working fine.
but when user delete a mid stage or the first stage,. then user rename the stages and all the flags using the rearrange button. even if the user adds motors under stage 1 , the motors are generating under the stage 2.
let me explain the problem in detail, lets say the user adds 3 stages.
and deleted the stage 1 and use the rearrange button to rename the stages and flags so. now there are 2 stages . stage 3 became stage 2. stage 2 became stage 1... but if the user adds motors under stage 1 . that was earlier. it is showin in the ui it is stage 1 , but the motors are generating under stage 2. its like in the front end. the stages are not updating. how to fix this. can adding a auto arrange will fix this issue, when user delete a stage regardless of anyone. later we have to also implement the functionality of always making the coasting toggle of stage 1 disabled. only the stage 1 . so even the user deletes a stage 1 then stage 2 has to renumbered and its coasting should be disabled. how to get around this
