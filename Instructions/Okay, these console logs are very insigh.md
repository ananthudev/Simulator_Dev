Okay, these console logs are very insightful and point to several distinct issues, primarily revolving around timing, DOM updates, and how optimization.js and openMissionHandler.js interact with shared/dynamic form elements.
Here's a breakdown of the problems and a plan to address them:
Problem 1: Segment Dropdown Not Populating Correctly
Log Evidence:
[Optimization] Populated STEERING segment dropdown for DV 1 with 2 components.
[Optimization] Populated STEERING segment dropdown for DV 2 with 5 components.
[OpenMission] DV (opt_steering_1): Segment option "Constant_Pitch_1" NOT FOUND in dropdown. Available values: Array(1)
[OpenMission] DV (opt_steering_2): Segment option "Profile_1" NOT FOUND in dropdown. Available values: Array(1)
Analysis: The number of components (steeringData.length) reported by populateSteeringSegmentForDV in optimization.js changes from 2 for the first Design Variable (DV) to 5 for the second. There are 5 steering components defined in your JSON (pitchHold_1, constantAngularVelocity_1, Constant_Pitch_1, Profile_1, Profile_2). This strongly suggests that getSteeringComponentData() (which populateSteeringSegmentForDV calls) is returning an incomplete list when the first DV form's segment dropdown is populated. The openMissionHandler.js log showing Available values: Array(1) means it only finds the default "--Select Segment--" option, as neither of the 2 components (if any were actually added with values) matched the target segment name.
Hypothesis: The steeringData array within steering-module.js (which getSteeringComponentData likely reads) might not be fully populated when optimization.js processes the category change for the very first DV. Even though openMissionHandler.js populates steering components before DVs, there might be an asynchronous aspect or a subtlety in how getSteeringComponentData accesses this data.
Problem 2: Independent Variable Dropdown for "PROFILE" Segment Type
Log Evidence:
[OpenMission] DV (opt_steering_2): Attempting to set independent variable to "PHASE_TIME". Options: Array(4)
[OpenMission] DV (opt_steering_2): Option for independent variable "PHASE_TIME" NOT FOUND.
(Similarly for opt_steering_3 and "PROFILE_TIME")
Analysis: The "Independent Variable" dropdown for "PROFILE" segments should have 5 options (TIME, ALTITUDE, VELOCITY, PHASE_TIME, PROFILE_TIME). The log indicates only 4 options are found by openMissionHandler.js. This means that when optimization.js populates this dropdown (likely in setupSteeringTypeSpecificFields or a related function like showProfileFields when segment_type is set to "PROFILE"), it's not adding all 5 options, or openMissionHandler.js is querying the options before they are fully rendered.
Problem 3: Axis Checkbox State and Bounds Visibility
Log Evidence (e.g., for opt_steering_1, axis "pitch"):
openMissionHandler.js: Sets axisCheckbox.checked = true and dispatches change event.
optimization.js (event handler): Logs Checkbox for pitch changed to false.
optimization.js (event handler): Logs Found bounds section for pitch, setting display to none.
openMissionHandler.js (after 1s delay): Logs Checked axis checkbox for "pitch". Waiting for DOM updates...
openMissionHandler.js: Logs Found bounds container for axis "pitch" (implying it's visible).
openMissionHandler.js: Logs Set lower bound for pitch to "1, -5.5" (populates the bounds).
Analysis: This is a direct conflict. optimization.js's event handler for the axis checkbox explicitly logs that it sees the checkbox as false (or sets it to false) and consequently hides the bounds section. However, openMissionHandler.js (after its delay) finds the bounds container visible and populates it.
Hypothesis:
The event handler in optimization.js (e.g., handleAxisCheckboxChange) incorrectly determines the checkbox's state to be false immediately after it's programmatically checked and the event is dispatched. This could be due to logic within the handler that re-evaluates and changes the checkbox state (e.g., the single-select logic for "CONST_BODYRATE" might be too aggressive or have a side effect).
The fact that openMissionHandler.js later sees the bounds as visible suggests that another event or piece of logic (perhaps also in optimization.js, or a subsequent action by openMissionHandler.js that's not obvious) makes the bounds visible again. This is messy. The primary issue is optimization.js incorrectly processing the initial programmatic check.
Solution Strategy:
I will make targeted changes to optimization.js as editing it directly seems more robust than adding more workarounds in openMissionHandler.js.
Fix Segment Dropdown Population (populateSteeringSegmentForDV in optimization.js):
The most critical part is to ensure getSteeringComponentData() returns the complete list of steering components every time populateSteeringSegmentForDV is called. Since steering-module.js should have this data ready, I'll ensure populateSteeringSegmentForDV uses it correctly.
I will also slightly adjust the logging in populateSteeringSegmentForDV to show the actual names of components it's trying to add.
Fix Independent Variable Dropdown (in optimization.js):
I will review the function in optimization.js responsible for showing PROFILE specific fields (likely showProfileFields or within setupSteeringTypeSpecificFields) and ensure it consistently populates the .dv-profile-independent-variable select element with all 5 standard options.
Fix Axis Checkbox Handling (in optimization.js):
The event listener for axis checkboxes in optimization.js needs to correctly respect the incoming event.target.checked state when the event is dispatched programmatically.
I'll carefully review the logic, especially for CONST_BODYRATE types, to prevent it from incorrectly unchecking a just-checked box. The goal is for optimization.js to see isChecked as true if openMissionHandler.js set it to true.
I'll start by reading the relevant sections of front_end/js/optimization.js to pinpoint the exact functions and lines of code.
Specifically, I'm interested in:
populateSteeringSegmentForDV (around line 3298 from previous context).
The function that populates the independent variable dropdown for PROFILE types (likely part of setupSteeringTypeSpecificFields, around line 3824).
The event listeners for axis checkboxes (likely part of addPerAxisBoundsListeners within setupPerAxisBounds, around line 7590).
After reviewing the optimization.js code, particularly populateSteeringSegmentDropdown, setupPerAxisBounds, and the PROFILE-specific field setup, I've identified the likely causes and have a plan to address them.

1. Segment Dropdown Population (populateSteeringSegmentDropdown in optimization.js around line 3277):
   Issue: The function uses window.steeringState?.activeComponents. This steeringState is likely managed by steering-module.js. The discrepancy in the number of components (2 for DV1, 5 for DV2) strongly indicates that window.steeringState.activeComponents is not fully populated or stable when populateSteeringSegmentDropdown is called for the first DV instance.
   Solution:
   The most reliable way to get steering components should be window.getSteeringComponentData() if it's globally available and returns the definitive list of defined steering components (names/IDs).
   I will modify populateSteeringSegmentDropdown to try and use window.getSteeringComponentData() if available, as this function is intended to provide the canonical list of steering segments. If window.getSteeringComponentData is not available or fails, it can fall back to window.steeringState.activeComponents with robust error handling. This prioritizes the static definition over a potentially dynamic/incomplete state.
2. Independent Variable Dropdown (for PROFILE type):
   Issue: The console logs show 4 options instead of 5 for the independent variable dropdown. The code for populating this is within handleSteeringSegmentTypeChange which calls showSteeringTypeSpecificFields, and for "PROFILE", it should be setting up specific inputs including the independent variable select.
   Solution: I need to ensure the .dv-profile-independent-variable select element within the Design Variable's "PROFILE" specific fields is correctly and consistently populated with all 5 options: TIME, ALTITUDE, VELOCITY, PHASE_TIME, PROFILE_TIME. I will examine the part of handleSteeringSegmentTypeChange or its helper functions in optimization.js that reveal these fields and ensure the options are hardcoded correctly for the DV forms.
3. Axis Checkbox and Bounds Visibility (setupPerAxisBounds and its directCheckboxHandler in optimization.js around line 7541):
   Issue: optimization.js logs that it perceives an axis checkbox (e.g., "pitch") as false and hides the bounds, immediately after openMissionHandler.js programmatically sets it to true and dispatches a change event.
   Analysis of directCheckboxHandler (around line 7595):
   Apply to test_opt.jso...
   If openMissionHandler.js sets checkbox.checked = true and dispatches, then checkbox.checked inside this handler should be true. The logs Checkbox for pitch changed to false and setting display to none indicate that checkbox.checked is false when this handler executes.
   This means the programmatic checkbox.checked = true by openMissionHandler.js is either not taking effect as expected before the event handler runs, or something else is interfering. The handler itself does not contain logic to uncheck other boxes for CONST_BODYRATE (that was in a previous version or a different handler). This directCheckboxHandler is simple: it just reflects the checkbox's state to the bounds visibility.
   Hypothesis for this specific problem: The issue might not be optimization.js changing the value, but rather how the event loop or browser handles the programmatic checked = true immediately followed by dispatchEvent.
   Solution:
   The directCheckboxHandler in optimization.js is simple and seems correct in its intent (reflect checkbox state to visibility). The problem is why checkbox.checked is false in the context of that handler.
   A robust way to ensure the bounds are shown when openMissionHandler.js intends them to be: After openMissionHandler.js checks a box, dispatches the event, and waits, it should then explicitly ensure the bounds section for that axis is visible if the data requires it, potentially overriding what the event handler might have done if there was a state mismatch. However, the root cause should be fixed.
   The most likely cause for checkbox.checked being false in the handler is if the change event is somehow being triggered twice, or if the browser's rendering of the checked property isn't instantaneous with the JS assignment before an event handler runs.
   I will slightly modify openMissionHandler.js: after checking the box and dispatching the event, and after the small delay, it will re-assert the checked state of the checkbox before attempting to populate bounds. This ensures that optimization.js's listener has fired, and we then set the final intended state.
   Let's apply these changes.
   Change 1: Modify populateSteeringSegmentDropdown in optimization.js
   I'll use window.getSteeringComponentData() as the primary source.
   Change 2: Ensure Independent Variable Options in optimization.js
   The options for .dv-profile-independent-variable are usually hardcoded when the "PROFILE" section is shown. I'll verify this part in handleSteeringSegmentTypeChange or its helpers.
   Change 3: Modify populateTypeDetails in openMissionHandler.js for axis checkboxes
   After axisCheckbox.dispatchEvent(new Event("change", { bubbles: true })); and the await delay, I'll add:
   axisCheckbox.checked = true; // Re-assert state
   And then, when checking visibility:
   if (boundsContainer) (instead of boundsContainer && boundsContainer.style.display !== 'none') and then explicitly make it visible: boundsContainer.style.display = 'block'; before populating. This makes openMissionHandler.js more authoritative about the final state.
   I will start by generating the edit for populateSteeringSegmentDropdown in optimization.js.
   The existing populateSteeringSegmentDropdown (lines 3277-3329) uses window.steeringState?.activeComponents. I need to find where getSteeringComponentData is defined to understand its structure. Assuming it returns an array of objects like { id: 'comp1', name: 'Component 1', displayName: 'Component 1', type: 'profile' } and displayName is what should be used for both value and text.
   Given the structure from the logs: Populated STEERING segment dropdown with 2 components. (from optimization.js) vs [OpenMission] DV (opt_steering_1): Segment option "Constant_Pitch_1" NOT FOUND in dropdown. Available values: Array(1). The optimization.js log comes from populateSteeringSegmentDropdown.
   The issue is that the components added by populateSteeringSegmentDropdown are not the ones openMissionHandler.js is looking for, or not enough are added.
   The populateSteeringSegmentDropdown function (around line 3277 in optimization.js) already has this log: Populated STEERING segment dropdown with ${activeComponentsArray.length} components.. This implies it thinks it's populating correctly based on window.steeringState.activeComponents.
   The user's JSON uses names like "Constant_Pitch_1" for the segment.
   populateSteeringSegmentDropdown uses option.value = comp.displayName; and option.textContent = comp.displayName;.
   So, comp.displayName from window.steeringState.activeComponents must match "Constant_Pitch_1".
   The core issue remains: Why activeComponentsArray.length is 2 for DV1 and 5 for DV2?
   This means window.steeringState.activeComponents changes. This state is likely updated by steering-module.js as steering components are added or configured in the main UI.
   When openMissionHandler.js processes the main steering section, it populates steering-module.js, which in turn should update window.steeringState.activeComponents. This should be complete before DVs are handled.
   If window.steeringState.activeComponents is unreliable during the initial DV population phase, then deferring the population of these dropdowns or finding a more static source is needed.
   refreshAllDesignVariableSegmentDropdowns() exists (line 7365). This is called in initOptimizationModule.
   Let's make populateSteeringSegmentDropdown more robust by logging the names of components it is adding. This will confirm if "Constant_Pitch_1" is among them when it claims to add "2 components".
   Now, for the Independent Variable dropdown (.dv-profile-independent-variable):
   The options TIME, ALTITUDE, VELOCITY, PHASE_TIME, PROFILE_TIME should be standard. If openMissionHandler.js sees only 4, it means the population of these options in optimization.js (when segment type becomes PROFILE) is incorrect or incomplete for the DV forms. This happens in handleSteeringSegmentTypeChange which calls showSteeringTypeSpecificFields. I'll need to inspect that specific part in optimization.js.
   For axis checkboxes:
   The directCheckboxHandler in optimization.js (lines 7595-7610) looks simple. If checkbox.checked is false in its context, it will hide the bounds. The problem is that checkbox.checked is false there, according to the logs.
   The most direct fix for openMissionHandler.js is to ensure the checkbox is checked and the bounds are visible after the event has been dispatched and optimization.js has reacted.
   Let's make a more conservative first edit to populateSteeringSegmentDropdown to add more logging. This will help confirm the exact component names being added.
