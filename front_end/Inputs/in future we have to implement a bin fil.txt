in future we have to implement a bin file file to plot view in the project. the astra c outputs a bin file with vehicle name, earlier we made a ui in python that loads the bin file and outputs the plots. we will implement the proper functionality later. but for now add a ui element somewhere to load the bin file independent of the project. analyze the @csvplot (2).py and refer the code only for bin file to plot code. this is just temporary so  make it easy to remove it.
