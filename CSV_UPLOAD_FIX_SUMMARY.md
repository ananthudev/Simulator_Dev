# CSV Upload Fix - Quick Summary

## ✅ Issue Fixed

The CSV upload UI state was being shared between steering components. When one Profile component uploaded a CSV, the clear button became visible in other components that didn't have CSV files.

## ✅ Solution Applied

Modified the `populateAndValidatePanel()` function in `front_end/js/steering-module.js` to properly synchronize CSV upload UI state when switching between components.

## ✅ How It Works Now

- **Component A uploads CSV** → Only Component A shows the filename and clear button
- **Switch to Component B** → UI shows "No file chosen" and hides clear button if Component B has no CSV
- **Switch back to Component A** → UI correctly restores the CSV filename and shows clear button
- **Component B uploads different CSV** → Only Component B shows its CSV, Component A retains its own state

## ✅ Testing Verified

- ✅ State isolation between components
- ✅ Proper UI updates when switching components
- ✅ CSV data storage working correctly per component
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## ✅ Files Modified

- `front_end/js/steering-module.js` - Added CSV UI state synchronization in `populateAndValidatePanel()`

The fix maintains full backward compatibility and resolves the UI state sharing issue completely.
